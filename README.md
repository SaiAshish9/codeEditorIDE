# codeEditorIDE
Extract codeminor zip folder provided in the public directory.
Run nodemon app.js command inside the directory via command line. 
Go to localhost:3000 in order to view this ide.  


This ide is not completed yet.Basically,I'm trying to use judge0 api in order to send my code present in the editor along with input data,
language code to judge0 submissions api and fetch the output of that data after sometime when it is completely executed ,with the help of
my submission token and ajax calls.
Then finally use the parsed data so obtained to display the output.

This is the preview of app prepared so far :

# codeEditorIDE
Extract codeminor zip folder provided in the public directory so that the appropriate editor gets displayed on the screen.
Run nodemon app.js command inside the directory via command line. 
Go to localhost:3000 in order to view this ide.  


Basically, in this app I used codemirror and judge0 api in order to send my code present in the source editor along with input data,
language code to judge0 submissions api and fetch the output of that data after its successful execution,with the help of
ajax calls and submission token generated at the time of successful submission of code.
Then I finally used the parsed data so obtained to display the output.

Few screenshots of  this app are as follows :
